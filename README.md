# Sage math language support in Atom
Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Sage math files in Atom. Currently limited to basic python syntax.

Originally forked from the atom.io [Python language bundle](https://github.com/atom/language-python), which was [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Python TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/python.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
